  ir    :: Axial Mach distribution number (for details see rmach.f)
           0 = Uniform
           1 = Linear shear
           2 = Read from file
           3 = Uniform + sine wave bndry layers of thickness delta

           9 = Hagen-Poiseuille flow
           
  rmax  :: Maximum axial Mach number

  slope :: slope of linear Mach distribution;
            also used as boundary layer thickness

  is    :: Swirl Mach distribution number (for details see smach.f)
           0 = No swirl
           1 = Solid body swirl

           3 = Solid body and free vortex together
           4 = $V_{\theta} = 1/r^2$ (for stability calcs)
           5 = Read from file
           6 = Constant swirl across the duct
           7 = Trailing line vortex

  angom :: Magnitude of solid body swirl $V_{\theta} = \Omega r$;
            also used as constant for constant swirl

  gam   :: Magnitude of free vortex swirl $V_{\theta} = \Gamma / r$

  ifd   :: Use finite differences for derivatives
           1 = Second order
           2 = Fourth order

  itest :: Perform consistency test on selected modes

  etahr :: Real part of hub liner admittance
  etahi :: Imag part of hub liner admittance

Output data:
  gamma :: Axial wavenumbers


Installation test:
 1. Copy "input.test" to "input.data"
 2. Run swirl
 3. Compare output file "gammas.dat" to "gammas.test"
 4. Compare output file "gam.nonconv" to "gam.non.test"
