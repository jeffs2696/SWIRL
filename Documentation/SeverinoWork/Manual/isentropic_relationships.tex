\section{Appendix B: Isentropic Waves}

\[dU = dW + dQ\]

For adiabatic, reversible processes, the work done by a system with constant pressure and a change in volume is $-pdV$ and the change in heat energy is zero. Hence,

\[dU = -pdV\].

The change in enthalpy of such a system can be found by taking the derivative of its expression for a thermodynamic process 

\[H = U + pV\]

\[dH = dU + pdV + vdP\]

\[dH = -pdV + pdV + vdP\]

\[dH = vdP\]

The specific heats at constant pressure and constant volume 

\[\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial T}\right)_v = C_v\]

\[\left(\frac{\partial H}{\partial T}\right)_p = C_p\]

\[\gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_v} = \frac{dH}{dU} = -\frac{VdP}{pdV} = -\frac{V}{dV}\frac{dP}{p}\]

Integrating both sides

\[\gamma \frac{dV}{V} = \frac{-dP}{P} \rightarrow \gamma \int \frac{1}{V} dV = - \int \frac{1}{P} dP\]

\[\gamma ln(V) + ln(P) = C\]

Using log rules

\[ln(V^\gamma) + ln(P) = C\]
 \[ln(pV^\gamma) = C \]
 \[pV^\gamma = e^C = C\]
 
 \[\frac{p}{\rho^\gamma}\]
