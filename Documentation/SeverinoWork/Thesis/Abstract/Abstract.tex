Over the last 20 years, there has been an increase in computational fluid dynamic 
codes that have made numerical analysis more and more readily available, allowing
turbomachine designers to create more novel designs. However, as airport noise
limitations become more restrictive over time, reducing aircraft 
takeoff and landing noise remains a prominent issue in the aviation community. 
One popular method to reduce aircraft noise is using acoustic liners placed on 
the walls of the engine inlet and exhaust ducts. These liners are designed to 
reduce the amplitude of acoustic modes emanating from the bypass fan as they 
propagate through the engine. The SWIRL code is a frequency-domain linearized 
Euler equation solver that is designed to predict the effect of acoustic liners
on acoustic modes propagating in realistic sheared and swirling mean flows, guiding
the design of more efficient liner configurations. The purpose of this study is
to validate SWIRL using the Method Of Manufactured Solutions (MMS). This study 
also investigated the effect of the integration and spatial differencing methods 
on the convergence for a given Manufactured Solution. In addition, the effect 
of boundary condition implementation was tested.  The improved MMS convergence
rates shown for these tests suggest that the revised SWIRL code provides more 
accurate solutions with less computational effort than the original formulation.
