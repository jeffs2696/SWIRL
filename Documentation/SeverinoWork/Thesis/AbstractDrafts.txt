Reducing aircraft noise has become a crucial issue in the aviation industry due to increasingly stringent airport noise restrictions. With stricter airport noise restrictions in place, it's more important than ever to find effective solutions to reduce aircraft noise. The solution lies in the use of acoustic liners, which can significantly lower the amplitude of acoustic modes, and choosing the right rotor and stator performance parameters that minimize the propagation of "cut-on" modes, which are low-frequency acoustic modes that become unstable and generate noise at a certain flow rate.
The SWIRL code, a cutting-edge solver, can predict the modal content present in ducted flow, as well as the impact of acoustic liners on these modes. The study aims to validate the SWIRL code using the Method of Manufactured Solutions and investigate its effect on convergence rates. The results show that the revised SWIRL code provides more accurate solutions and improved convergence rates as well as verify SWIRL against limited analytic solutions, making it a promising tool for reducing aircraft noise.

The aviation industry is facing a growing challenge of reducing aircraft noise due to the implementation of stringent airport noise restrictions. To address this issue, the use of acoustic liners and optimization of rotor and stator performance parameters have been proposed as potential solutions. The current study focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of the SWIRL code, a state-of-the-art solver, in predicting modal content in ducted flow and the impact of acoustic liners on such modes. The validation of the SWIRL code was conducted using the Method of Manufactured Solutions and the results indicate a significant improvement in accuracy and convergence rates. Furthermore, the revised SWIRL code was verified against limited analytic solutions, demonstrating its potential as a tool for mitigating aircraft noise.

In recent decades, there has been a massive surge in the development of computational fluid dynamic codes that make numerical analysis more accessible than ever before. This has empowered turbomachine designers to come up with innovative and cutting-edge designs. However, as airport noise restrictions become increasingly stringent, reducing aircraft take-off and landing noise continues to be a pressing issue in the aviation industry.

One effective solution to reducing aircraft noise is the use of acoustic liners, which are placed on the walls of engine inlets and exhaust ducts. These liners are specifically designed to lower the amplitude of the acoustic modes produced by the bypass fan as they move through the engine. The SWIRL code is a cutting-edge, frequency-domain linearized Euler equation solver that can predict the impact of acoustic liners on acoustic modes in realistic swirling and sheared mean flows, leading to the creation of more efficient liner configurations.

Another effective solution is to choose the rotor and stator performance parameters such that the least number of acoustic modes are propagating at a given time. The types of modes of most concern are categorized as “cut-on “ modes.

Cut-on modes are low-frequency acoustic modes in a ducted system, such as an axial flow compressor, that become unstable and begin to generate noise at a certain flow rate. The term "cut-on" refers to the flow rate at which the mode becomes unstable and starts to generate sound.

In an axial flow compressor, the noise generated by cut-on modes can be significant and can impact the overall performance and efficiency of the system. Therefore, understanding and controlling cut-on modes is an important aspect of designing and operating axial flow compressors. This may involve modeling the acoustic behavior of the system, as well as experimenting with different design parameters, such as the geometry of the duct or the location of acoustic liners, to minimize the impact of cut-on modes.

The goal of this study is to validate the SWIRL code using the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and to investigate the effect of the integration and spatial differentiation methods on convergence for a given Manufactured Solution. Additionally, the impact of boundary condition implementation was tested. The results of this study show that the revised SWIRL code provides more accurate solutions with improved MMS convergence rates, requiring less computational effort compared to the original formulation.

In conclusion, this study highlights the potential of the SWIRL code as a powerful tool for reducing aircraft noise through the use of acoustic liners. The results of this study offer significant promise for the future of aircraft noise reduction and underscore the importance of continued investment in this field.
