1. First, describe a situation
 There is a growth of CFD that is tandem with an engineers ability to access for rigorous 
 computational tools
2. Next, describe a problem or question that arises from that situation
However,given more complex geometries , there are more complex Flows and therefore
more complex aeroacoustic behavior.
3. Now describe how others have approached that problem or question
Aeroacoustic contributions
4. Explain a need To approach it in a different way or expand upon what's been done befOre
Provide a means of V&V that is formal and can aid the engineer in synthesizing the results 
5. What you aim to do

Example


State a Situation for why I am to do what I do:

UntiL the mid 90s, an aeroacoustics model for swirling flow had not been published.
It was only with the work in 1996 by Kousen (with his approach)that it waS first investigated. Golubev and 
Attassi had their contribution however this is work is not expanding on that

Our theory is a response to this "discovery" Or a response to a "preexisting theory"

Lit Review Notes:

1. You do not have to show how much you read 

2. Every paper is a rePsonse to a probleM or question or situation (or a previous
paper)

3. You can set these with the context of a general situation that exists with 
the literature
