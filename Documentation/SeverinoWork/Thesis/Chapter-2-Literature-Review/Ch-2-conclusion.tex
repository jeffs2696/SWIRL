\section{Conclusion}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The conclusion summarizes 
        the key findings of the review in general terms. Notable commonalities between works, whether favorable or not
        , may be included here.
        \subitem This review discusses the development of the unsteady linearized equations, 
        and how improvements in the modal analysis capture more families of mechanisms of noise generation within non-uniform 
        swirling flow turbomachinery flow. 
    \item This section is the reviewerâ€™s opportunity to justify a research 
        proposal. Therefore, the idea should be clearly re-stated and supported according to the findings of 
        the review.
        \subitem This literature review should be expanded to describe specific details in the methodologies and validation techniques reported by \cite{Kousen1996,Kousen1999,Golubev1996,Golubev1998}.
