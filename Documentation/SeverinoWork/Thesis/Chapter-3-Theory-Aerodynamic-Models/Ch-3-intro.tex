\section{Introduction}
This chapter will outline the steady and unsteady aerodynamic
models used for this study. The MMS procedure as it is used in this study will 
be described. The summation method used to generate symbolic expression will 
be breifly described. This chapter will also present the use of fairing functions 
to impose the equivallent boundary conditions used in the numerical approximation.
The procedure for calculating the approximated rate of convergence for a system
of equations is also presented.
