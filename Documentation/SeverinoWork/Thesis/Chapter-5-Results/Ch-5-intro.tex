\section{Introduction}
The frequency domain, linearized Euler equation computer code, SWIRL, was 
sufficiently verified through the Methods of Manufactured and Exact solutions. 
However, while MES can verify SWIRL, there is a limitation on the number of 
exact solutions available based on the flow and domain. Slight changes in a 
flow configuration (uniform axial flow vs. sheared axial flow, without any tangential 
component) require a recalculation of the analytical solution. Code verification 
through MES is often complicated for the case of uniform flow in a cylindrical 
duct since the exact solution requires implementing special Bessel functions
. In addition, the exact solution needs to be recomputed for changes in radii 
and the use of acoustic liner (i.e., boundary conditions). For this reason, 
the more comprehensive MMS was first used for code verification to test each 
variable in the governing equations and gain measurable acceptance criteria 
without relying on expert judgment.

MMS was implemented on a component level since SWIRL consists
of two main numerical approximations for flows with axial and tangential 
components. First, the numerical integration technique required for radial 
change in sound speed was verified. Then, the four governing equations that make
up the matrices required for the eigenvalue problem were tested. Note that the 
output of the eigenvalue problem is not tested with MMS. It is the input to the 
eigenvalue problem that is being verified. The calculated $L_{2,norm}$ (i.e.
error and the order of accuracy for both numerical methods are discussed below.
