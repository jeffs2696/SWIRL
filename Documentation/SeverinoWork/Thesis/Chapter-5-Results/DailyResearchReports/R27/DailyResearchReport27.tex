\section{Current Research Direction}
The goal today was to finish running SWIRL for the Method of Manufactured Solution 
and gather all data for the two test cases. One for an annular duct, one 
for a cylindrical duct.

\section{Research Performed}
Worked on the body of the MMS report, but I went back to make sure I have all the 
data needed for both cases.


\section{Issues and Concerns}
My current draft of my methods, and procedure is okay but needs a better results 
and discussion section.
\section{Planned Research}
\begin{itemize}
    \item MMS for the two cases have to have all the data that is needed
    \item Solution Validation for a case of my choosing. I chose one that is simple
        but has not been done before (in the literature that I read)
\end{itemize}
