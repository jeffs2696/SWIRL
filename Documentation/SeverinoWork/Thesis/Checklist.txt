Some quick notes:

p. 1: The aircraft is NOT slowing down at takeoff.  This is the second
time I've pointed this out.
- Removed

p. 1:  Please consider introducing the distinction between tone noise
and broadband noise -- SWIRL is focused on tone noise propagation, and
liners are designed to attenuate known tones.

- This is needed

p. 1: The word 'nacelle', or 'duct', is MISSING STILL.  This is the 
second time I've pointed this out.

- Added 

Figure 1-1 came from somewhere -- make sure to reference both in the
text and the caption. SECOND TIME.

- Referenced


'need ... is going to be needed':  consider a different phrasing. SECOND TIME.
- removed first need 

(insert refs): please do. SECOND TIME.

linearized Euler equations:  this is because the sound waves are low
amplitude compared to the mean flow, and their presence does not
appreciably change the mean flow field. SECOND TIME.
-Added
LEE: make sure to introduce 'linearized Euler equations (LEE)' prior to
using the acronym. SECOND TIME.
-Included acroynm in the first appearance of LEE
'...where the solution is': for this particular configuration -- not in
general. SECOND TIME.
-Addressed
'Swirling flow has been a difficult problem...': Is there an analtyical
solution for axially sheared flow (which is parallel to the walls of
the duct)? SECOND TIME.

- Goldstein described the complete solution to sheared flows, I have include 
citations and additional mentioned to free vortex swirl and solid body swirl.

'Various methods of code validation...':  you're jumping to code verification,
which is a different question.  A code for plug flow cases will also need
to be verified... SECOND TIME.

- I removed the jump and tied it to maldanados work. I should be more specific
on the rotating rake

'approximating the right equations':  how about 'correctly approximating
the governing equations'? SECOND TIME.
