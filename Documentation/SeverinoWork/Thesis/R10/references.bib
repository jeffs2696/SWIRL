A consistent multiple-scales solution for the mean flow and disturbance is derived, and the effect of finite-impedance boundaries on the propagation of disturbances in mean swirling flow is also addressed.</p>},

    abstract = {The objective of this paper is to expose the computational aeroacoustics (CAA) community to the current unresolved issues in modeling and predicting fan noise. The paper includes a description of the sources of fan noise and a discussion of the current status of the fan noise prediction methods and their shortcomings. The discussion is focused on the issues and includes sufficient details to help outline the scope of the fan noise problem and define the level of fidelity required for meaningful CAA simulations.},
