Clea (as in up the derivation section -- the reader does not need to see every
manipulation that occurs during the process.  Strip it down to the high points,
leaving the necessary 'breadcrumbs' for them to follow.  Currently, this section
looks like a homework submission, not a thesis.  To be clear:  there's way 
too many slightly-different equations here.  Please keep in mind that there 
needs to be a reason that you're showing each equation to the reader .

- Working on this, the similar literature has more concise format. Most work is needed 
to clean up analytical solution. however It can be simplified to one equation

The eigenvalue index number is irrelevant, since there's not a standard order in 
which eigenvalues and eigenvectors are calculated.  To be clear:  LAPACK is 
giving you the list of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for the matrix, and it's up 
to you to determine which ones you need.  To be clearer: there are enough 
numerical issues involved in calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors that it 
wouldn't surprise me if the index numbers changed from run to run for the same matrix.  
Again:  the index numbers are irrelevant -- please don't bother reporting them (even if Kousen did).

Will mention this in discussion but not in initial results, 

For the last test case shown:  isn't there an analytical solution?  
If so, where is it?  Second:  why don't you plot the change in eigenvalue 
as a function of grid spacing -- how much are they changing?

There is one in literature and the analytical solution depends on a separation constant 
which changes from the boundary condition.  I can present this as well. 
It is the I will include the plots for the change in
eigenvalue as a function of grid spacing.  They can also be compared to Kousens 
I'll get that in.

Finally:  I'd suggest that you remove the SWIRL output file names -- is there a reason that the reader needs to know what the output format of SWIRL is?

Will remove
