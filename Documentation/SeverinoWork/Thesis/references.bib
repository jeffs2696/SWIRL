    abstract = {<p>The propagation of unsteady disturbances in a slowly varying cylindrical duct carrying mean swirling flow is described. A consistent multiple-scales solution for the mean flow and disturbance is derived, and the effect of finite-impedance boundaries on the propagation of disturbances in mean swirling flow is also addressed.</p>},
