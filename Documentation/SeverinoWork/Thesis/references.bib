    abstract = {The propagation of acoustic disturbances in a slowly-varying duct with mean swirling flow and non-uniform mean entropy is considered. This is representative of the region of swirling flow downstream of the rotor in aeroengine applications where variations in mean entropy can be significant. The duct is assumed to vary slowly in axial cross section and a consistent multiple-scales solution is derived. The variation in axial wavenumber and amplitude of the duct modes is determined as part of the solution. Comparisons are made between the cases of isentropic and non-isentropic flow. The cut-on/cut-off characteristics of a given mode are altered by any form of non-uniform mean entropy, with modes pushed closer to cut-off resulting in larger variations in amplitude. The greatest departure from the baseline isentropic result occurs for a positive entropy gradient. Increasing the swirl velocity at the duct inlet leads to increasing levels of mean entropy. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {In this paper we consider the spectrum and stability properties of small-amplitude waves in three-dimensional inviscid compressible swirling flow with non-zero mean vorticity, contained in an infinitely long annular circular cylinder. The mean flow has swirl and sheared axial components which are general functions of radius. We describe the form of the spectrum, in particular the three distinct types of disturbance: sonic (or acoustic) modes; nearly-convected modes; and the non-modal continuous spectrum. The phenomenon of accumulation of infinitely many eigenvalues of the nearly-convected type in the complex wavenumber-plane is classified carefully: we find two different regimes of accumulating neutral modes and one regime of accumulating instability modes, and analytic conditions for the occurrence of each type of behaviour are given. We also discuss the Green's function for the unsteady field, and in particular the contribution made by the continuous spectrum. We show that this contribution can grow algebraically downstream, and is responsible for a new type of convective instability. The algebraic growth rate of this instability is a complicated function of the mean flow parameters, and can be arbitrarily large as a function of radius in cases in which the local convected wavenumber has a local extremum. The algebraic instability we describe is additional to any conventional modal instability which may be present, and indeed we exhibit cases which are convectively stable to modes, but which nevertheless grow algebraically downstream.},

@article{Posson2013,
    abstract = {This paper is concerned with modelling the effects of swirling flow on turbomachinery noise. We develop an acoustic analogy to predict sound generation in a swirling and sheared base flow in an annular duct, including the presence of moving solid surfaces to account for blade rows. In so doing we have extended a number of classical earlier results, including Ffowcs Williams & Hawkings' equation in a medium at rest with moving surfaces, and Lilley's equation for a sheared but non-swirling jet. By rearranging the Navier-Stokes equations we find a single equation, in the form of a sixth-order differential operator acting on the fluctuating pressure field on the left-hand side and a series of volume and surface source terms on the right-hand side; the form of these source terms depends strongly on the presence of swirl and radial shear. The integral form of this equation is then derived, using the Green's function tailored to the base flow in the (rigid) duct. As is often the case in duct acoustics, it is then convenient to move into temporal, axial and azimuthal Fourier space, where the Green's function is computed numerically. This formulation can then be applied to a number of turbomachinery noise sources. For definiteness here we consider the noise produced downstream when a steady distortion flow is incident on the fan from upstream, and compare our results with those obtained using a simplistic but commonly used Doppler correction method. We show that in all but the simplest case the full inclusion of swirl within an acoustic analogy, as described in this paper, is required. © 2013 Cambridge University Press.},

    abstract = {The future growth of global air passenger traffic will undoubtedly be subject to unanticipated shocks. While the nature and timing of these shocks cannot (by definition) be predicted, looking at how the industry has come through previous shock events can help to assess how it is likely to fare in the face of future shocks. As shown in Figure 1, in the past global air passenger traffic has always seemed to bounce back strongly from short-term upheavals. 1 Using a similar methodology as Njegovan (2006) 2 we have examined the statistical characteristics of global air passenger traffic since 1950 and find evidence that global air passenger traffic has indeed reverted to an underlying growth path over the long run (See Annex A.) Part of the reason why global air traffic has proven so resilient relates to the large declines in the real cost of air travel seen over time. Between 1950 and 1970, the dawn of the jet age, global air passenger traffic increased by over 10% per year as rapid technological improvements brought down the cost of jet travel by an average of over 5% a year. There was a significant change in the trend growth rate of air travel in 1970, as indicated by our statistical analysis. Nonetheless, the real cost of air travel has still fallen by 1.7% per year on average since 1970 and the underlying rate of air traffic growth has averaged 4.4% per year. The resilience of air travel also reflects increases in living standards and disposable incomes over time. All told, it has become increasingly affordable for more and more people to fly over time. With a projected 400 million people in emerging and developing countries joining the middle class in the coming five years, the long-term upward trend looks set to continue. In fact, global air passenger traffic is expected to more than double over the coming 20 years. 3},

In contrast to the situation in nonswirling flows, vorticity, pressure, and entropy fields are not independent.

In the course of the propagation, there is an interchange between radial and tangential velocity perturbations. General conditions for propagation of pressure modes in the strongly swirling flow show the effects of rotation to be small if the frequency is large compared to base rotational frequency.

    abstract = {It is shown that the pressure and velocity fluctuations of the unsteady motion on a transversely sheared mean flow can be expressed entirely in terms of the derivatives of two potential functions. One of these is a convected quantity (i.e. it is frozen in the flow) that can be specified as a boundary condition and is related to a transverse component of the upstream velocity field. The other can be determined by solving an inhomogeneous wave equation whose source term is also a convected quantity that can be specified as a boundary condition in any given problem. The latter is related to the curl of the upstream vorticity field. The results are used to obtain an explicit representation of the three-dimensional gust-like or hydrodynamic motion on a transversely sheared mean flow. It is thereby shown that this motion is ‘driven’ entirely by the two convected quantities alluded to above.The general theory is used to study the interaction of an unsteady flow with a scmi-infinite plate embedded in a shear layer. The acoustic field produced by this interaction is calculated in the limits of low and high frequency. The results are compared with experimental one-third octave sound pressure level radiation patterns. The agreement is found to be excellent, especially in the low frequency range, where the mean-flow and convective effects are shown to have a strong influence on the directivity of the sound.},

    abstract = {The current trends for turbofan engines are towards shorter nacelles and increased distances between the fan and the outlet guide vanes. This leads to an overall reduction in lined surface areas as well as an increase in the relative importance of the interstage liner, which is the liner placed between the rotor blades and the stator vanes. So far most of the efforts have been on liners for intakes and bypass ducts (in terms of physical insight, prediction methods and experimental data). The interstage is different in that the liner is subject to a mean flow with a strong swirl component and shear. This paper aims to evaluate the effect of swirl on liner attenuation in annular ducts. The analysis presented is based on the governing equations for an isentropic swirling mean flow and a homentropic unsteady field. The eigenvalue problem is obtained by applying normal mode analysis to the linearized Euler Equations together with the Ingard-Myers boundary condition. Mean flow properties are assumed to vary with radius only. A fourth order finite difference code is compared against published results for specific flows such as solid body and free vortex swirl. Results from the Finite Difference Code are compared to measured data from the Advanced Noise Control Fan (ANCF) from NASA Glenn Research Center.},

A necessary condition for the existence of hydrodynamic modes is derived. © 2001 by the National Aerospace Laboratory NLR. Published by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.},

    abstract = {Sound transmission in a finite-length lined annular duct with mean swirling flow is investigated using mode-matching methods. The main application of this work is the acoustics of aeroengine duct systems, especially the prediction of sound transmission behind a fan/rotor stage where the swirl velocity could be comparable to the axial velocity. First, a spectral collocation technique is used to determine the eigenmodes of three-dimensional linearized Euler equations, then two mode-matching schemes are utilized for calculating the sound transmission in ducts. The two schemes are compared with each other and also with the finite element method. The modified matching scheme is believed to deal with the impedance discontinuity more accurately at the interface. A sound power definition for high frequencies in the presence of mean swirling flow is used for the analysis of sound transmission characteristics. The modified matching scheme is then used to analyze the effect of mean swirling flow on the sound power transmission loss and conduct liner optimization in the impedance plane, compared with the uniform axial mean flow case. Finally, sound attenuation due to inner wall lining, outer wall lining, and combined inner and outer wall lining, respectively, is investigated. Copyright © 2008 by ASME.},

@article{Tyler1962,
    abstract = {The basic processes for the generation, transmission and radiation of noise in an axial-flow compressor have been explored by means of a combined analytical and experimental program. It has been demonstrated that the pressure field generated in the compressor consists of spinning mode patterns; that the number of lobes in each pattern, together with the frequency of the pressure fluctuations, gives the speed at which the pattern spins; and that there is a critical pattern speed which separates the subsequent behavior of the pattern into one of two different categories. If the tip Mach number with which the pattern sweeps the duct wall is below critical, as is the case for a subsonic rotor, the intensity rapidly decays with distance from the rotor. If, however, the rotor is operating in combination with stator vanes, many patterns are generated, some of which may be spinning above their critical tip Mach numbers. These high-speed patterns propagate along the duct and radiate sound to the outside. An analytical process for determining the rotor-stator interaction patterns has been presented, and experimental procedures for confirming the presence of these patterns have been described. Finally, the angular distribution of sound radiated from the face of a compressor duct has been treated, so that the effects of the propagating patterns can be studied in free-field. An understanding of these basic phenomona is requisite to intelligent analytical or experimental study of axial flow compressor noise. This paper is by no means exhaustive. Continued exploration in this area is required in order to answer important questions. However, the tools are now available to carry on in a productive manner.},

    abstract = {A procedure for code Verification by the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) is presented. Although the procedure requires a certain amount of creativity and skill, we show that MMS can be applied to a variety of engineering codes which numerically solve partial differential equations. This is illustrated by detailed examples from computational fluid dynamics. The strength of the MMS procedure is that it can identify any coding mistake that affects the order-of-accuracy of the numerical method. A set of examples which use a blind-test protocol demonstrates the kinds of coding mistakes that can (and cannot) be exposed via the MMS code Verification procedure. The principle advantage of the MMS procedure over traditional methods of code Verification is that code capabilities are tested in full generality. The procedure thus results in a high degree of confidence that all coding mistakes which prevent the equations from being solved correctly have been identified.},

    abstract = {Computational simulation can be defined as any computer application which involves the numerical solution to a system of partial differential equations. In this paper, a broad overview is given of verification procedures for computational simulation. The two aspects of verification examined are code verification and solution verification. Code verification is a set of procedures developed to find coding mistakes that affect the numerical discretization. The method of manufactured solutions combined with order of accuracy verification is recommended for code verification, and this procedure is described in detail. Solution verification is used to estimate the numerical errors that occur in every computational simulation. Both round-off and iterative convergence errors are discussed, and a posteriori methods for estimating the discretization error are examined. Emphasis is placed on discretization error estimation methods based on Richardson extrapolation as they are equally applicable to any numerical method. Additional topics covered include calculating the observed order of accuracy, error bands, and practical aspects of mesh refinement. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

    abstract = {The flow disturbance caused by fittings in a pipe generates an intense internal sound field which propagates throughout the piping system. It excites the pipe wall vibrations which in turn generate external sound. The pressure and velocity spectra (Agarwal, PhD Thesis, 1985) of the internal sound field show a strong plane wave component at low frequencies and the presence of higher order acoustic modes at the higher frequencies. Thus, in the study of external noise radiation from piping systems excited by the internal wall pressure field, it is important to know the propagational characteristics of both axisymmetric and asymmetric acoustic modes. Most of the earlier studies of propagation of sound in circular ducts are limited to the use of a mean-velocity distribution given by a power-law with uniform flow in the core. In this paper, theoretical results are presented for sound propagation in a hard walled pipe with a fully developed turbulent flow profile. © 1989.},

Either two dimensional or axially symmetric ducts with sheared flows can be studied, although the examples cited are two dimensional.

Results indicate that a useful level of accuracy can be achieved with a modest number of elements. Spurious eigenvalues, easily identified by obviously inconsistent eigenvectors, occur in certain instances. If the number of elements is not too small, these spurious modes are among the higher order eigenvalues of otherwise questionable accuracy.

    abstract = {2nd ed. Aircraft Engines and Gas Turbines is widely used as a text in the United States and abroad, and has also become a standard reference for professionals in the aircraft engine industry. Unique in treating the engine as a complete system at increasing levels of sophistication, it covers all types of modern aircraft engines, including turbojets, turbofans, and turboprops, and also discusses hypersonic propulsion systems of the future. Performance is described in terms of the fluid dynamic and thermodynamic limits on the behavior of the principal components: inlets, compressors, combustors, turbines, and nozzles. Environmental factors such as atmospheric pollution and noise are treated along with performance.This new edition has been substantially revised to include more complete and up-to-date coverage of compressors, turbines, and combustion systems, and to introduce current research directions. The discussion of high-bypass turbofans has been expanded in keeping with their great commercial importance. Propulsion for civil supersonic transports is taken up in the current context. The chapter on hypersonic air breathing engines has been expanded to reflect interest in the use of scramjets to power the National Aerospace Plane. The discussion of exhaust emissions and noise and associated regulatory structures have been updated and there are many corrections and clarifications.Jack L.

Starting from a given acoustic source pressure distribution the field is to be calculated everywhere. Such a calculation is effected here for cylindrical and annular ducts. The eigenvalue problem resulting from the assumption of complete separability in all the variables is solved numerically for the lowest and the next ten additional eigenvalues fin and the corresponding eigen-functions & These eigenfunctions are then combined by a least total error squared method to represent the initial pressure distribution. This procedure leads to the pressure pattern everywhere in the duct. The calculation of distinct eigenvalues is not entirely straightforward. Some guidance is therefore given as to how the eigenvalues may be located. Among a number of typical calculations, cases with wall admittance are presented. They show clearly that the combined refractive-attenuation effects are indeed complicated. Lowest mode calculations may be very misleading.},
