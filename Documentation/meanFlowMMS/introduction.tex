\section{Introduction}
The Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS) is a process for generating an 
analytical solution for a code that provides the numerical solution for a 
given domain. The goal of MMS is to establish a manufactured solution that can 
be used to establish the accuracy of the code within question. For this study, 
SWIRL, a code used to calculate the radial modes within an infinitely long duct
is being validated through code verification. SWIRL accepts a given mean flow and 
uses numerical integration to obtain the speed of sound. The integration technique
is found to be the composite trapezoidal rule through asymptotic error analysis.
