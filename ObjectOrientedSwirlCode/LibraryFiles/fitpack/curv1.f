c                                 coded by alan kaylor cline

c
c this subroutine determines the parameters necessary to
c compute an interpolatory spline under tension through
c a sequence of functional values. the slopes at the two
c ends of the curve may be specified or omitted.  for actual
c computation of points on the curve it is necessary to call
c the function curv2.
c
c on input--
c
c   n is the number of values to be interpolated (n.ge.2).
c
c   x is an array of the n increasing abscissae of the
c   functional values.
c
c   y is an array of the n ordinates of the values, (i. e.
c   y(k) is the functional value corresponding to x(k) ).
c
c   slp1 and slpn contain the desired values for the first
c   derivative of the curve at x(1) and x(n), respectively.
c   the user may omit values for either or both of these
c   parameters and signal this with islpsw.
c
c   islpsw contains a switch indicating which slope data
c   should be used and which should be estimated by this
c   subroutine,
c          = 0 if slp1 and slpn are to be used,
c          = 1 if slp1 is to be used but not slpn,
c          = 2 if slpn is to be used but not slp1,
c          = 3 if both slp1 and slpn are to be estimated
c              internally.
c
c   yp is an array of length at least n.
c
c   temp is an array of length at least n which is used for
c   scratch storage.
c
c and
c
c   sigma contains the tension factor. this value indicates
c   the curviness desired. if abs(sigma) is nearly zero
c   (e.g. .001) the resulting curve is approximately a
c   cubic spline. if abs(sigma) is large (e.g. 50.) the
c   resulting curve is nearly a polygonal line. if sigma
c   equals zero a cubic spline results.  a standard value
c   for sigma is approximately 1. in absolute value.
c
c on output--
c
c   yp contains the values of the second derivative of the
c   curve at the given nodes.
c
c   ierr contains an error flag,
c        = 0 for normal return,
c        = 1 if n is less than 2,
c        = 2 if x-values are not strictly increasing.
c
c and
c
c   n, x, y, slp1, slpn, islpsw and sigma are unaltered.
c
c this subroutine references package modules ceez, terms,
c and snhcsh.
