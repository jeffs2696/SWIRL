Questions:

What should we do about beta(i) being zero?

The code finds these zeros currently but the issue is we need to know the
corresponding row so that aa and bb are the correct dimensions. 
In other words, ZGGEV returns the eigenvalues in the form of:

   wvn = alpha(i)/beta(i)

should we put ZGGEV in an interface to catch any other errors?
