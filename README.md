## Description
The code was originally written in Fortran 77 and is accompanied with the paper
"Kousen, Kenneth A. "Eigenmodes of ducted flows with radially-dependent axial 
and swirl velocity components." (1999)." [Here is the paper](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/10475014.pdf)

## How To Use
The main Makefile is in the SourceFiles folder. The Makefile compiles SWIRL,
runs the executable, and displays a latex report with the results plotted
