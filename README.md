# SWIRL

SWIRL analyzes axial flows with mean shear and swirl in lined and unlined ducts.

The code was originally written in Fortran 77 and is accompanied with the paper
"Kousen, Kenneth A. "Eigenmodes of ducted flows with radially-dependent axial 
and swirl velocity components." (1999)." [Here is the paper](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/10475014.pdf )
