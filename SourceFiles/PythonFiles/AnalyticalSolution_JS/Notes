there needs to be documentation written on the code to make sure the mode extraction proceess is cleaner. 

Breadcrumbs for 10/14/22/
make sure the plotting and data are separate whuich will determine which loops are right
fix wavenumver filename_list variable so you can do both second order and fourth


the annotation for the numerical wavenumbers do not have a sign for a superscript 
at the moment. However, t_{2,0} has a duplicate? There can only be one. By coincidence 
I looked at the t_{2,0} mode that was closest to the analytic solution, but it
is shown in the wavenumber plot there is two instead of just one, and, the duplicate
is closest to the k_{2,2} mode.

The other apparently wrong mode is the -+t_{2,8} pair. Looking at the modes
, there are high wavenumber fluctuations in the solution around 0 that are
an artifact of the numerical solution
