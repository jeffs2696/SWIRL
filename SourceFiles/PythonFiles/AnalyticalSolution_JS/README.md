# Fundamentals of Duct Acoustics Toolkit (FDAT)

## A set of codes that compute the analytic solution to the convective wave equation applied to ducted sound propagatiion

The goal of this repository is frame the problem of sound propagation in ducted flows 
in a well-understood form and offer functions that calculate the exact solution.

* Cylindrical duct modes in the radial and circumferential direction
* Normalization functions to compare radial modes to experimental data
