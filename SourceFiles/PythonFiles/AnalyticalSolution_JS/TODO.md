# Priority 
- [ ] loop through radial mode number from 0 to number of zeros i.e. number of
radial modes
- [ ] compute the L2 for each identified mode for both radial mode and axial wavenumber
- [ ] compute the Lmax and index location 
- [ ] compute velocities from pressure using known expressions and relevant errors

- [ ] Once done, document, document, document

# Secondary
-[ ] Make modules
 - [x] output radial wavenumber, radial mode for the same wavenumber.
 - [x] account for m = 0 in axial_wave_number_quadratic_function
 - [ ] account for annular ducts in the axial_wavenumber_quadratic function
 - [x] figure out a way to import modes where the input is an acceptable decay
