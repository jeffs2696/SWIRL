\section{Introduction - Turbomachinery Noise}
Turbomachinery noise generation occurs from pressure fluctuations from the series 
of fans within it's annular duct. While the jet that is produced from this stream
of air freely radiates to the observer, the pressure fluctuations 
produced from the rotor may or may not propagate out of the inlet and exhaust and 
radiate to the observer. The production of this propagation can be characterized
by standing waves referred to as modes, in particular, duct modes because 
the mode itself is dependent on the geometry of the column of air within the 
annular duct, as well as the speed of the flow moving through it

\section{Duct Mode Theory}

The pressure field within a duct is governed by the convective wave equation, a
second order ODE as a function of radius. 


The solution of the convective wave equation are eigenvalues and eigenvectors 
which may or may not correspond to acoustic disturbances fall into two groups.  
One group corresponding to the acoustics propagation and the other group 
corresponding to the convection speed of the flow. Both are modes that are a
result from the pressure distribution from within the cylindrical domain.

\subsection{ Analytic Solution: Axial wavenumbers and Pressure Modes}

Modes can be categorized based on the sign of the axial wavenumber and if it is
complex in value. For example, for the uniform axial flow case, propagating modes
are defined by axial wavenumbers, $k_x$, that have a real-part only, yielding 
the assumed fluctuation to resemble Euler's Formula ($e^{ik_x x}$). On the other 
hand, if the $k_x$ is complex, then the mode will resemble an exponentially decaying
function since the imaginary number cancels, leaving a minus sign in front of
the axial wavenumber. These two distinctions are referred to as ``cut-on'' and 
``cut-off'' in the field of ducted sound propagation. Furthermore, the sign of 
the imaginary part will change the direction of the mode's decay. If $k_x$ is 
positive, the decay rate occurs in the negative direction. Conversely, if $k_x$ 
is negative, the decay occurs in the positive direction. The axial wavenumber
for uniform axial flow in a hollow duct is,

\begin{equation}
    k_x  = \frac{- M_x k \pm \sqrt{k^2 - ( 1 - M_x^2) k_{r,m,n}'^2 }}{\left( 1 - M_x^2 \right)}.
    \label{eqn:ax_wavenumb}
\end{equation}

where $M_x$ is the axial Mach number, $k$ is the temporal (referred to as reduced)
frequency, and $J_{m,n}'$ is the derivative of the Bessel function of the first kind.  
The $\pm$ accounts for both upstream and downstream modes. See Appendix for detailed
derivation.

The condition for propagation is such that the axial wavenumber is larger than 
a ``cut-off'' value

\begin{equation}
    k_{x,real}  = \frac{\pm M_x k }{\left( M_x^2 - 1 \right)}.
    \label{eqn:cuton}
\end{equation}

Every term that is being raised to the one half i.e. square rooted must 
be larger than zero to keep axial wavenumber from being imaginary. The mode 
will propagate or decay based on this condition.
