    abstract = {The treatment of the geometrical singularity in cylindrical and spherical coordinates has for many years been a difficulty in the development of accurate finite difference (FD) and pseudo-spectral (PS) schemes. A variety of numerical procedures for dealing with the singularity have been suggested. The authors investigate a method for treating the coordinate singularity whereby singular coordinates are redefined so that data are differentiated smoothly through the pole, and they avoid placing a grid point directly at the pole. This eliminates the need for any pole equation. Despite the simplicity of the present technique, it appears to be an effective and systematic way to treat many scalar and vector equations in cylindrical and spherical coordinates},
