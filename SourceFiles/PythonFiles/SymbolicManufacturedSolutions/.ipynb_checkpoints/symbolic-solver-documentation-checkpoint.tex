Introduction

The method of manufactured solutions (MMS) is a general procedure for constructing an analytical solution and determining the accuracy via convergence rate. As a result, MMS serves as a means of code verification. In this work, SWIRL, a code used to calculate the radial modes within an infinitely long duct, is validated using MMS. SWIRL has two components that require numerical techniques and approximation. First, SWIRL accepts a given mean flow and uses numerical integration to obtain the speed of sound.  Secondly, SWIRL constructs a linear matrix equation using the Linearized Euler Equations (LEE) as a function of radius. This work aims to use the Method of Manufactured solutions to reassure that these two steps lead to accurate results.
