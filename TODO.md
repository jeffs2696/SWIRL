# Necessary updates to SWIRL

### Todo

- [ ] Cleaning up Python code 
  - [x] Combine the tanh summation(TS) code with the fairing function(FF) Code
  to impose desired boundary conditions
  - [ ] Incorporate the TS/FF code with the existing symbolic solver
  - [ ]   
- [ ] Make sure all the data types are the same in SWIRL 

### In Progress

- [ ] Integrate the fairing function with the existing symbolic solver
- [ ] Clean up FORTRAN codes by incorporating several derived data types 


### Done âœ“

- [x] Complete Fairing Function Script
